      <h1>Who is running for Mayor in New York City?</h1>
      <h4> By Olivia Bensimon, March 9, 2021</h4>

      <p> Here we are, a little over three months out from the June primary where New Yorkers will all but elect the next mayor, and there are many candidates to think about. Here, you can use the drop down menus to filter candidates per issue they
        stand for. </p>
      <p> It’s important to note that a majority of the candidates are running as Democrats (19 of them here, to be exact) and that sorting them along issues is not easy, and that the short bios are not enough to make a decision! The filtering is not
        perfect. I encourage you to click on the candidates’ image where you’ll be redirected to their online platform to learn more about them and what they propopse as mayoral candidates.</p>
      <p> This is the first iteration of this project and will refocus the filtering as we get closer to the primary election. </p>
